## Welcome to Amin Akhtar's Pages

My current role at Willis Towers Watson (WTW):

As a software developer at WTW, I develop two web applications called PensionPath and Benefit Connect. These two websites allow our clients calculate and have access to their retirement and health plans. In my current position, I use C#, ASP.NET, C++ and SQL Server to design and develop these new features.

Working in the Agile environment as a part of a team of 15 members provides me with this opportunity to use my knowledge as part of a team. I gain valuable experiences by working with Project Managers, Business Analysis, and Actuarial experts.
